## python-bitcoin_easy

This python3 library provides easy interface to create, sign and send to the network bitcoin transactions. Also it demonstrates using of simple miner. It was tested on python version 3.6. 

##Requirements
* binascii
* base58
* ecdsa


*For examples see start_bitcoin.py  file*


### Generating new private key, public key, address

    generate_keys_bitcoin.generate()

### Creating transaction, sign it and sending to the net

    tx_bitcoin.getSignedTran(previous_output, output_index, sender_address, private_key,  receivers, ischeckbalance = True, fee = -1)
    
Params 
1. outputs         - dict of previous outputs in format {'output':'output_index'}
2. sender_address  - sender address 
3. private_key     - private key for sender address
4. receivers       - dict of receiver in format {'address':'amount of nitcoin in satoshi'}. It's possible to send to several addresses
5. ischeckbalance  - check before creating transaction if there is enough bitcoins on my_adress
6. fee             - Amount of fee for miners. You can put here aby fee. If this param is negative, fee will be calculated based on recomendation of bitcoin network
                         The more fee the faster transaction will be proceed. You can try put the fee as much as zero (0), in this case transaction will be proceed with the lowest priority or may be never)


Example:

    sender_address  = "1694jeVGow1MQ6qp1kA4LA9Xi4LkKYj2aP"
    private_key     = "581dda14fd1731039b2b0632d5288849daf87f010222a5757b31a82e481c3d64"
    receivers = {"1BR1TupFa6AGbnkKqihpYqyEPRfUPZnPrn": 120000, '12b7p5DrNxnTSDMURfWX1RCbbZvsoHnEVi' : 5000}
    outputs   = {"b9d934eef14574a614303b702df92572d5016e80f29796a849201b2bcc02d308" : 0,   "67f44eebe97cf72a6819274d063642453a3b530a11a61fe5fa9d3d2c32720d3b" : 1}

you can see details for this address here: https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/address/1694jeVGow1MQ6qp1kA4LA9Xi4LkKYj2aP

    txn    = tx_bitcoin.getSignedTran(outputs, sender_address, private_key, receivers)
    txnHex = binascii.hexlify(txn).decode('ascii')
    print('Transaction hex: ', txnHex)

Sending transaction to the network

    node_bitcoin.Simple_node(ip_to_connect = '')

Params
1. ip_to_connect - ip of working node in the net. You can find it for example using command "nslookup dnsseed.bluematt.me" or any oyher method. It's also possible to leave this parametr empty, in this case ip of working node  will be found automaticly

Example:

    simple_node = node_bitcoin.Simple_node('84.35.69.10')
    simple_node = node_bitcoin.Simple_node()
    simple_node.send_transaction(txn)



###  Mining

    miner_bitcoin.Miner(reciever, message)

Params 
1. reciever     - dict of previous outputs in format {'output':'output_index'}
2. message      - sender address 

 Example:

    reciever = '1FGGdEdNtHiQwKnq9YdPPuLU18EA1JoKSC'
    message  = 'Mined by me'
    
    miner = miner_bitcoin.Miner(reciever, message)
    miner.start()
